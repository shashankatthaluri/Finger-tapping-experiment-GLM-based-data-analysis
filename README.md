# Finger-tapping-experiment-GLM-based-data-analysis
we analyse data from a real multichannel functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) experiment (see GLM Analysis (Simulated) for a simplified simulated analysis). 
The experiment consists of three conditions:
1. tapping with the left hand,
2. tapping with the right hand,
3. a control condition where the participant does nothing.

We use a GLM analysis to examine the neural activity associated with the different tapping conditions. 
Step 1: Import raw NIRS data

Step 2: Clean up annotations before analysis

Step3: Preprocess NIRS data

Step 4: View experiment events

Step 5: Create design matrix

Step 6: Examine expected response

Step 7: Fit GLM to subset of data and estimate response for each experimental condition

Step 8: Fit GLM to all data and view topographic distribution

Step 9: Analyse regions of interest

Step 10: Compute contrasts

Step 11: Export Results

Step 12: Determine true and false positive rates
